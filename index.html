      <h2 id="about">About me</h2>
      <p>
        Antonia is a spoken word poet and public speaker living in Stockholm.
        Her spoken word career started in 2018 at the Swedish poetry slam
        championships, which was the first time she ever read poetry in front of
        an audience. Since that day spoken word poetry is a her biggest passion.
        She is a multiple finalist in the Swedish poetry slam championships and
        is well know in the poetry community in Sweden for her passionate
        performances.
      </p>
      <p>
        Antonias poetry is raw and vulnerable, inviting listeners in to her
        heart and soul and bringing them along as a companion on her journey
        towards self-development and healing. Being half British she writes most
        of her poetry in English, allowing a wide range os listeners to take
        part. She uses poetry as her medium to connect with people through
        vulnerable storytelling, aspiring to plant seeds of hope in her
        listeners hearts. She is an activist at heart and brings that with her
        into a lot of her poetry, but also wears her heart on her sleeve every
        time she steps on a stage hoping to inspire others to do the same.
